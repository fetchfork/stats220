# The Stats 220 Demo Repo

## Enter the world of statistics

This is me demonstrating and learning how to make a ReadMe Repo for my Stats 220 Course from the univeristy of auckland.

 * I've got *Demoes*
 * And I've got **Repoes!**

Here are some fun facts about me:
 1. I've never watched the Lion King
 2. I also have interests in video making
 3. I'm currently doing a degree in communications!

This so far is just what I can do with a limited amount of time. Some time in the future, I'd like to make this a lot prettier!
